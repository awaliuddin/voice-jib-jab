## Description

Implement a PIIRedactor stub in Lane C that can scan transcript or response metadata for potential PII and redact or flag as configured. Ensure redacted content is used in audit logs and tool calls as appropriate.

## Dependencies

- T-002

## Locked Files

- `server/src/insurance/policy_gate.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PIIRedactor scans input text for PII patterns (stubbed)
- [ ] Redacted output is used for audit and tool call events
- [ ] Policy decision events include PII reason_codes when detected
- [ ] Stub supports future expansion with more robust detection
