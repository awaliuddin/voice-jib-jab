  "description": "Run automated tests for task T-007.\nReview changes and verify acceptance criteria.\nOriginal: Implement the FallbackPlanner as a stub module that supports safe fallback maneuvers (ask clarifying question, refuse politely, switch to text summary, escalate to human, offer to send email/link). Integrate with LaneArbitrator and Lane C for triggering fallback patterns.\nCriteria:\n- FallbackPlanner supports all specified fallback maneuvers as stub functions\n- FallbackPlanner can be invoked by LaneArbitrator on policy cancel\n- Fallback mode is configurable\n- Fallback events are logged in AuditTrail",
