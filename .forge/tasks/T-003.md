## Description

Extend the Lane C ControlEngine and LaneArbitrator to support policy cancel events that immediately stop Lane B audio and trigger fallback handling. Ensure the fallback planner is invoked and the correct arbitration state transitions occur.

## Dependencies

- T-002

## Locked Files

- `server/src/lanes/laneC_control.ts`
- `server/src/orchestrator/LaneArbitrator.ts`
- `server/src/insurance/fallback_planner.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Policy cancel event from Lane C stops Lane B audio playback
- [ ] FallbackPlanner is invoked when cancel_output is triggered
- [ ] LaneArbitrator transitions to FALLBACK_PLAYING state
- [ ] Session resumes listening after fallback completes
