## Description

Implement the AllowedClaimsRegistry as a stub service that can match claims in transcript or response metadata against an approved claims list. Integrate with Lane C ClaimsChecker and ensure it emits the correct policy decision events.

## Dependencies

## Locked Files

- `server/src/insurance/allowed_claims_registry.ts`
- `knowledge/allowed_claims.json`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AllowedClaimsRegistry can load and match claims from allowed_claims.json
- [ ] ClaimsChecker uses AllowedClaimsRegistry to check claims in input
- [ ] Policy decision events include reason_codes when claims are disallowed
- [ ] Stub supports future hardening for production
