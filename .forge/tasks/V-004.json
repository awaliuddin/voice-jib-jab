  "description": "Run automated tests for task T-005.\nReview changes and verify acceptance criteria.\nOriginal: Implement a PIIRedactor stub in Lane C that can scan transcript or response metadata for potential PII and redact or flag as configured. Ensure redacted content is used in audit logs and tool calls as appropriate.\nCriteria:\n- PIIRedactor scans input text for PII patterns (stubbed)\n- Redacted output is used for audit and tool call events\n- Policy decision events include PII reason_codes when detected\n- Stub supports future expansion with more robust detection",
